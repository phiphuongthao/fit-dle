                            pain related to the cervical spine may be caused by a pinched nerve, whiplash, degenerative disc disease, spinal stenosis or arthritis in the neck. Neck pain caused by an infection can affect the throat and lymph glands and
                            neck pain that directly affects the muscles is known as fibromyalgia.</p>
                        <h2>Neck Pain Relief</h2>
                        <p>Neck pain affects millions of individuals every year. Whether neck pain is acute or chronic, statistics show that approximately 80% of adults are affected by some neck pain condition. In some instances neck pain relief can be achieved
                            by practicing proper posture, exercising regularly, practicing yoga and leading a healthy lifestyle. The first step in protecting your neck is learning about the anatomy and how the components of the neck work together.</p>
                        <h2>Neck Pain Symptoms</h2>

                        <ul>
                            <li>
                                Tingling

                            Neck Pain Causes
                        </h2>
                        <p>The causes of neck pain are vast. Some neck pain conditions a patient may experience in regions away from the neck, such as tingling in the arm which can be caused by a pinched nerve in the neck or on the contrary, a condition
                            such as cervicalgia which is non-nerve related. What exactly causes a pinched nerve in the neck? In older people neck pain and pinched nerves are commonly caused by degeneration, in other words, our bodies wears out (much like
                            a tooth wears out). Pinched nerves can also be caused by bulging discs, where the material that makes up the disc (the cushion between our vertebrae) is compressed and bulges out of its normal shape pressing up against a nerve.
                            Injuries are also another common cause of neck pain. Read more on the causes of neck pain and the associated conditions.</p>
                        <h2>Neck Pain Treatment</h2>
                        <p>Treatment for neck pain and problems vary depending on the individual case. When neck pain is acute, sometimes a change in sleeping habits, such as a neck pain pillow is enough to help the body recover from neck pain. In other
                            cases, over the counter medication, neck stretches or exercises may help relieve painful neck conditions. When there is a specific condition causing chronic neck pain individuals usually start on the conservative end of the
                            treatment spectrum and work their way to the surgical end of the spectrum until their quality of life is bearable. Somewhere in between conservative and surgical some neck pain sufferers try alternative treatments such as acupuncture
                            or acupressure for neck pain relief. Visit neck pain treatment for an in depth look at each type of treatment and what to expect for recovery.</p>
